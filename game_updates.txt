Updating the simulator to the latest version can be done by:
cd ~/Tournament_Files

git pull

./update_everything.sh


1 - The simulator now has measurement noise. 

2 - In the real tournament, the quads will start from the ground, 
    not from the initial published position, as it happens now. 
    This means that you will have to add some states to your state 
    machine that should take the quad from its initial position on 
    the ground to your desired initial position for the game. I will 
    make some modifications to our simulator to have the quads starting 
    from the ground, and you should expect that to change soon. 

3 - The game can only start when all quads are at their initial 
    "game position". This means that all quads have to notify the 
    mediation layer that they are ready to start. I will setup a ros 
    service for you to communicate with the mediation layer that you 
    are ready.

4 - When all quads are ready to start, the mediation layer should 
    notify both teams that the game has started, and that both teams 
    can run their strategies. Only then you can start your strategy. 
    I will also setup this interface in the next few days.

5 - As of now, the balloons are freely floating in the simulation. 
    However, they are actually attached to a rod in our arena. 
    Therefore, I will add a repulsion zone below the balloon so that 
    you don't hit that rod. This should not affect your strategy, but 
    I guess you should be aware that this is how it will be.

6 - All quads will start without a shield. Its up to you to add/remove
    shields.

7 - I will create a message for landing all quads. You should land all
    your quads once you receive this message!
